# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying and analyzing sentiments expressed toward specific aspects or features within a piece of text. 
**SpaCy** is a popular Python library for natural language processing, but it does not have built-in functionality specifically designed for ABSA. 

However, you can use SpaCy in combination with other libraries and techniques to perform aspect-based sentiment analysis.
